/**
 * Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets 
 * too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we 
 * would likely start a new stack when the previous stack 
 * exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure 
 * SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be 
 * composed of several stacks and should create a new 
 * stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. 
 * SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave 
 * identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should 
 * return the same values as it would if there were just a 
 * single stack).
 * 
 * FOLLOW UP
 * Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a 
 * pop operation on a specific subÂ­ stack.
